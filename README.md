# SmartRestaurant
A Python program which helps a restaurant to have their customers order their food through electronic devices made available in their tables. The food order will automatically be updated in the chef's kitchen, and chef can make food accordingly. Customers don't have to wait so long in queue, or wait for the waiters to come to their tables.
